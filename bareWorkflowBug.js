This error typically occurs when you try to use an Expo managed workflow feature (like push notifications or some device APIs) in a bare workflow project.  The Expo modules needed for these features aren't available in a bare workflow environment because you're directly managing your native iOS and Android projects. The error message might not always clearly state this incompatibility. You might see various related errors during build or runtime.

```javascript
// Example code that might trigger the error in a bare workflow:
import * as Notifications from 'expo-notifications'; // This import will fail

Notifications.requestPermissionsAsync();
```
